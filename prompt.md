Transform the following transcript into concise, well-structured, and visually engaging lecture notes.

Guidelines:

- **Enhance Readability:**

  - Use clear headings, bullet points, lists, callouts, tables, and other Obsidian Markdown features to improve comprehension.

- **Complete Understanding in One Read:**

  - Expand on key ideas with clarifications, alternative explanations, and additional details to ensure the notes are self-sufficient.
  - Fill in any missing information that enhances comprehension.

- **Improve Examples & Explanations:**

  - Refine existing examples and provide additional intuitive analogies, more examples, real-world applications, or step-by-step breakdowns for complex concepts.
  - When appropriate, include visual descriptions to aid understanding.

- **Mathematical Clarity:**

  - Use proper LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions:

        - Inline equations: $...$ (e.g., $y = mx + b$).
        - Block equations: $$...$$ (e.g.,

    $$
    w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}, \quad
    b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}
    $$

    )

        - Do NOT use \(...\) or \[...\].

- **Structured & Organized Output:**

  - Ensure logical flow and clear topic separation.
  - Use progressive layering, starting from fundamental concepts and building up to advanced topics.

- **Final Output Format:**
  - Return the final structured notes inside a Markdown-formatted code block (markdown) for direct use in Obsidian.
