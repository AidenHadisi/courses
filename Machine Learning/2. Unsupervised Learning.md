## **Introduction**
- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or structures in data without pre-labeled outputs ($y$).
- In **unsupervised learning**, data contains only inputs (**x**) but no output labels (**y**).
- The algorithm identifies patterns, structures, or interesting features within the data.

### Comparison with Supervised Learning:
  - **Supervised Learning**: 
	  - Data is labeled (e.g., benign/malignant tumors).
	  -  Input data (**x**) is paired with labels (**y**).  
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: 
	  - Data has no labels; the goal is to identify patterns or interesting structures.
	  - Only input data (**x**) is provided; no labels.
## **Clustering Algorithms**
Clustering is a key type of unsupervised learning where data is grouped into clusters based on similarity.

### **Example 1: Google News Clustering**
- **Problem**: Group news articles based on similar content.
- **Process**:
  - Analyze words in articles (e.g., "panda", "twins", "zoo").
  - Automatically group articles into clusters without supervision.
- **Key Insight**: No human intervention needed; the algorithm identifies meaningful groups autonomously. (i.e. it automatically finds words to use for finding similar news articles.)

### **Example 2: Clustering Genetic/DNA Data**
- **Dataset**: DNA microarray data:
  - **Columns**: Represent genetic activity of individuals.
  - **Rows**: Represent specific genes (e.g., eye color, height, vegetable preference).
- **Process**:
  - Colors (e.g., red, green) indicate gene expression levels.
  - Clustering groups individuals into types based on gene expression patterns.
- **Outcome**: Automatically identifies distinct genetic categories without predefined labels.

### **Example 3: Market Segmentation**
- **Dataset**: Customer data from companies or communities.
- **Application**:
  - Group customers into segments to tailor services.
  - Example from DeepLearning.AI:
    - **Segments**:
      - Knowledge seekers (skills development).
      - Career-focused individuals (promotions/new jobs).
      - Field-specific AI updates (impact on work).
- **Purpose**: Understand and serve different groups more effectively.

## **Key Concepts**
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No "right answers" provided; the algorithm discovers patterns.
- **Clustering**: A specific unsupervised learning technique to group data into clusters.
- **Real-World Examples**:
  - Google News: Groups articles by topic.
  - DNA Microarrays: Clusters individuals by genetic expression.
  - Market Segmentation: Identifies customer groups.

## Examples of Unsupervised Learning
1. **Clustering**:
   - Groups similar data points together.
   - Example: Grouping news articles using a clustering algorithm (e.g., Google News).

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies unusual events or data points.
   - Applications:
     - **Fraud Detection**: Detecting suspicious transactions in financial systems.
     - Identifying irregular patterns in various domains.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Compresses a large dataset into a smaller one with minimal information loss.
   - Applications:
     - Visualizing high-dimensional data.
     - Reducing computational complexity for large datasets.
