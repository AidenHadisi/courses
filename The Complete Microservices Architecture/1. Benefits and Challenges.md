## Benefits
- Unlike monolithic architecture which is 3 parts total and logic part is only one part, microservices architecture organizes business logic as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployed services.
- Services have a narrow scope of responsibility
- Allows for smaller codebase which loads faster in IDEs
- Build time is shorter due to smaller size
- Easier to test in isolation as there is much less logic to understand
- Easier to onboard new engineers
- Higher velocity 
- Each instance consumes less resources, can run on cheaper servers
- Can use different tech stack, can rewrite in different languages faster
- We get higher stability since issues such as bugs and memory leaks affect small service

## Challenges
- Method calls become network calls and therefore no longer have predictable behavior, success and performance. 
- Testing might not be as accurate since once all microservices are deployed, there is a chance that they might not work with each other as a whole.
- Once we deploy, we have less confident in the fact that our service will not break others.
- It becomes harder to troubleshoot performance issues. How can we know which microservice is responsible for the issue?
- If each service uses different tools and languages we might end up with a lot of duplicated stuff. 
- Big ball of mud (Distributed Monolith)
