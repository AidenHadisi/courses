Transform the following transcript into concise, well-structured, and visually engaging lecture notes.

Guidelines:

- Enhance Readability: Use clear headings, bullet points, lists, callouts, tables, and other Obsidian Markdown features to improve comprehension.
- Complete Understanding in One Read: Add explanations, clarifications, and missing details so that someone reading the notes can understand everything without referring to the transcript.
- Improve Examples & Explanations: Expand on key concepts by adding practical examples, intuitive analogies, or step-by-step breakdowns where necessary.
- Mathematical Clarity: Format equations and formulas using LaTeX syntax for Markdown by enclosing it in `$...$` for inline math, `$$...$$` for block math.
- Structured & Organized Output: Ensure logical flow and clear separation of topics.
- Final Output Format: Return the final structured notes inside a Markdown-formatted code block (markdown) suitable for Obsidian.
