## Building blocks
1. **Clients**
2. **Container**
3. **Microservices**
4. **API Gateway:** Clients make a request to a single API gateway and that routes it to microservices
5. **Authentication service**
6. **Event bus:** allows microservices to communicate with each other in async event driven fashion. consumers don't care where it comes from. Producers don't care about what consumes them.

## Rest APIS
- Are prefect for microservices
- Are stateless. Server doesn't need to know about state of client and vice versa

## API Gateway
- Creates a unified access point to access microservices
- Acts as a reverse proxy that routes requests to specific microservices
- Can perform things such as authentication, SSL verification,  load balancing, etc
- Can limit HTTP verbs allowed
- If a service is moved, we can simply update API gateway and clients don't need to know about the change.

## Event Bus
- Backbone of decoupled microservices architecture 
- Pub/Sub pattern. Similar to Observer pattern but event bus takes role of middle man so publishers don't need to know about what consumers there are 

## Security
- Use external OAuth 2.0: Access tokens are generated by an authentication server
- Add authentication in API Gateway
- If implementing own service, use JWT: A set of claims in key/value pairs
